I followed these instructions:

Install cmake GUI:
brew install --cask cmake

Don't use
brew install cmake 
as this will only install the command line tool.

Open CMake.app and select "Configure". If needed, set CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk

Enable ENET_SHARED

Click "Open Project" to open Xcode. 

In Xcode: Edit Scheme > Run > Build Configuration 
"Release" select.

Build with Xcode
